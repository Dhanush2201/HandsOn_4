##Problem 2
Proving Time Complexity: 
The time complexity of the algorithm can be analyzed as follows: 
Building the initial min heap: The initial heap construction takes O(K*log(K)), where K is the number of arrays.
Merging the arrays: In the worst case scenario, each element in each array only needs to be handled once. The time complexity for this step is O(NK*log(K)), where N is the size of each array, because each push and pop operation on the heap requires O(log(K)) and there are NK elements in total. As a result, the algorithm's overall time complexity is O(NKlog(K)), where K is the number of arrays and N is their respective sizes.
Possible Improvements: 
Use Alternative Data Structure: Taking into account other data structures such as sorted lists or priority queues in place of a min heap may help lower the algorithm's time complexity.
Optimize Heap Operations: The overhead related to using the built-in heapq module may be decreased by implementing custom heap data structures or by optimizing the heap's operations.
Parallel Processing: By investigating methods for merging arrays in parallel, particularly for big and numerous arrays, processing times may be reduced overall.
Input Streamlining: By investigating methods for merging arrays in parallel, particularly for big and numerous arrays, processing times may be reduced overall.
Space Optimization: Reducing needless data duplication or taking into account in-place merging techniques could optimize space complexity.
